      Cardano is a decentralized, self-sustaining blockchain platform that uses
      smart contracts to facilitate transactions and enforce legal agreements.
      It has been developed by the Cardano Foundation and is based on the
      blockchain technology known as Plutus. Cardano has gained significant
      traction in the cryptocurrency market, with over 100 million users
      worldwide.
